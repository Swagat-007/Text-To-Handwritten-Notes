Red Velvet is a South Korean girl group formed and managed by SM Entertainment. They debuted on August 1, 2014 with the digital single "Happiness" with the four-member line-up of Irene, Seulgi, Wendy and Joy. Yeri joined the group in March 2015, following their first major release, Ice Cream Cake. Musically, the work of Red Velvet reflects their own group name: their predominantly-pop "red" side experiments occasionally with electronic, funk and hip hop, while their "velvet" side focuses on '90s-influenced R&B with elements of ballad and jazz.

The group's Korean-language discography includes two studio albums, one reissue album, one compilation and nine extended playsâ€”eleven of which topped South Korea's Gaon Album Chart. Hit singles "Red Flavor" and "Power Up" charted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart; with other singles charting in the top five, including "Happiness", "Ice Cream Cake", "Dumb Dumb", "Russian Roulette", "Rookie", "Peek-a-Boo", "Bad Boy" and "Psycho". The group ventured into the Japanese music scene with the extended plays #Cookie Jar (2018) and Sappy (2019).
